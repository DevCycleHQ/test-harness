# Overview

The README.md for the proxy was generated from an OpenAPI spec using [widdershins](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins).

`options.json` contains a configuration for `widdershins`. The full list of options can be found [here](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins#options).

## Generating the README.md

1. To re-generate the README.md, you will need to install `widdershins`:

```
npm install -g widdershins
```

2. In the `docs` directory run:

```
widdershins --environment ./widdershins/options.json spec.yaml -o README.md
```

# Testing and Mocks

- In this project, test files are almost always placed directly in feature or module directories using the `.test.ts`, `.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, or `.spec.js` suffix.
- The use of `__tests__/` folders is rare; the suffix-based convention is the primary approach.
- Test and script files themselves are excluded from this rule.
- Mock implementations are placed in `__mocks__/` directories within each package or module, such as [harness/mockData/](mdc:harness/mockData) or [harness/mockServer/](mdc:harness/mockServer).
- This convention is followed in both the main test harness and all SDK proxies.
